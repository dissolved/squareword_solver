# Setup

You'll need to have Firefox and geckodriver installed at the time of this writing. On a Mac using Homebrew,

```bash
brew install --cask firefox
brew install geckodriver
```

You'll also want to install the Python requirements (ideally into a virtual environment)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
